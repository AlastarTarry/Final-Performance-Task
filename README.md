# Final-Performance-Task
This repository documents all of my work on the Gr. 10 CompSci Final Performance Task.

In this game, you play as a wizard. You have health potions to increase your health and mana potions to increase your mana. You also have two abilities- staff whack and fireball.

You are to use those abilities and items sparingly and use them strategically to defeat your enemies, of which there are 4 different types, each stronger than the last. There is the goblin, knight, golem, and dragon. Each will have different behaviours, and they will try to target your weaknesses.

Once you have died, you will be escorted to the main screen. If you win, you will receive a victory screen for your efforts.

Multiple enemies will appear one at a time, and the game will not end until you have died or you have defeated all of your enemies.

Use the up and down arrows for the menus, and switch between the two using the tab key.
